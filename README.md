## 1. Gender Classification

Tensorflow model to classify if a given image is of male or female using CNN to achieve 96% accuracy on a training set & 95% on a testing set. Finally, Used opencv haar cascade to detect a face in real-time & predict the output. To train & validate a model I have used a dataset from kaggle.
