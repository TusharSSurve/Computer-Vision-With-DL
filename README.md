## 1. Gender Classification

Tensorflow model to classify if a given image is of male or female using CNN to achieve 96% accuracy on a training set & 95% on a testing set. Finally, Used opencv haar cascade to detect a face in real-time & predict the output. To train & validate a model I have used a dataset from kaggle. It consist of 47000 training examples & 12000 validation examples. Link to download dataset:- https://www.kaggle.com/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset

## 2. Face Mask Detection

Tensorflow model to classify if a given image face has face mask or not using CNN to achieve 97% accuracy on a training set & 96% on a testing set. Finally, Used opencv haar cascade to detect a face in real-time & predict the output. To train & validate a model I have used a dataset from internet. It consist of 2682 training examples & 1151 validation examples. Special thanks to **Prajna Bhandary** for the dataset.
